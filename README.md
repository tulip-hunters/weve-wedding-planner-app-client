### Technical Requirements
Your full-stack application must meet the following technical requirements:

1. Have a SPA frontend, built with React, consisting of multiple views and implementing all CRUD actions.
2. Have a REST API backend built with ExpressJS, MongoDB and Mongoose, that your React app will communicate with.
3. Have a REST API backend with routes that perform all CRUD actions for at least one model (excluding the user model).
4. Have 3 database models or more. Having one model for users is the first step. The other two (or more) models should represent the main functionality of your app.
5. Include sign-up, log-in and log-out functionality with encrypted passwords (or social login) and authorization (logged-in users can do additional things).
6. Have two separate repos on GitHub. One repo is for your frontend React application and the other is for your backend REST API.
7. Have at least 2 commits per day that you worked on.
8. Have a backend validation and centralized error handling in your REST API.
9. Be deployed online, allowing anyone to access and use your app.
10. As a final step, check all the features outlined in points 1 - 5 and ensure they are implemented and working ahead of delivery.

### Deliverables
Students must submit the following deliverables in order for the project to be deemed complete:

- A working app that meets all technical requirements, built by you.
- A working app deployed on Fly.io/Netlify.
- The two URLs of your GitHub repositories (frontend and backend).
